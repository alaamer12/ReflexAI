# 📄 **ReflexAI — Functional Requirements Document**

---

## **1. System Overview**

**ReflexAI** is a text-based human–AI interaction system designed to promote reflective thinking by generating self-questions about a user’s written content.
Users can upload text files, view AI-generated reflective questions, mark them as to-dos, and provide written replies. The system maintains a memory of user responses to avoid redundant questioning in future sessions.

---

## **2. System Goals**

1. Enable users to engage in deeper reflection through AI-generated self-questions.
2. Support text-based interactions for accessibility and simplicity.
3. Provide a structured interface for managing AI questions as actionable to-dos.
4. Maintain personalized learning and history through stored user replies.
5. Ensure adaptive questioning — the AI should **not repeat** previously answered or resolved questions.

## **5. System Workflow Summary**

1. **User opens ReflexAI → starts session.**
2. **User uploads file(s).**
3. **System reads and analyzes content → generates self-questions.**
4. **Questions appear as checkbox list (to-do style) in right panel.**
5. **User can reply to each question (text only).**
6. **Replies and completion status are saved.**
7. **Next time, ReflexAI remembers answered questions → avoids repetition.**
8. **User can export or review reflection history anytime.**

---

## **6. Example User Flow**

1. User uploads `project_draft.docx`.
2. ReflexAI analyzes text and generates 5 questions:

   * “What metric defines trust here?”
   * “Who decides what fairness means in this context?”
3. User marks Q1 as done, writes reply:

   > “We define trust via post-survey user confidence scores.”
4. ReflexAI stores this reply.
5. In future uploads, if a similar sentence appears, AI **skips** re-asking that question.
6. User exports reflection summary for documentation.

---

## **7. Future Extensions**

* Multi-user collaboration (shared sessions with reflection merge).
* Semantic clustering of questions (themes like ethics, usability, clarity).
* Integration with document editors (Google Docs / VS Code plugin).
* Emotion-awareness layer: question tone adapts to user stress level.

---

## ✅ **Summary**

ReflexAI’s main functional goal is to enable **reflective, question-driven collaboration** between human and AI using **text-only interaction**.
It prioritizes *clarity, memory, and personal growth*, ensuring users not only improve a document but also *learn how they think.*

Would you like me to now create the **UI functional layout** (showing where the upload zone, document area, AI question to-do list, and reply boxes go) — suitable for your prototype or Figma blueprint?
